About
=====

Edit with Emacs is an addon for webextension compatible browsers like
Google's Chrome(ium), Opera or Firefox that allows you to edit text
areas on your browser in a more full featured editor. It does this in
conjunction with an "Edit Server" which services requests by the
browser. This is because extensions cannot spawn new processes as a
security measure.

The extension packages a native elisp version that can be downloaded,
just follow the instructions from the options page of the extension.
It has been known to work with GNU Emacs and Aquamacs (MacOS); it is
presently not compatible with XEmacs.

Other example edit servers can be found at the project homepage. There
is no reason why other server scripts could not spawn other editors
and currently a number of servers support the simple URL based
protocol.

This extension is licensed under the GPL v3 and development versions
can be found at: http://github.com/stsquad/emacs_chrome

Installing
==========

As mentioned above there are two parts you will need. The edit server
which needs to be installed and configured on Emacs and the browser
extension itself.

Edit Server
-----------

Perhaps the easiest way to install edit-server.el is via
[MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/edit-server) which provides a range of
packages that can be installed via the package manager:

    M-x package-install edit-server

Once installed you will want to update your configuration so the
server is started before you edit. For example using the popular
[use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package) config
framework you might do something like this:

    (use-package edit-server
      :ensure t
      :commands edit-server-start
      :init (if after-init-time
                  (edit-server-start)
                (add-hook 'after-init-hook
                          #'(lambda() (edit-server-start))))
      :config (setq edit-server-new-frame-alist
                    '((name . "Edit with Emacs FRAME")
                      (top . 200)
                      (left . 200)
                      (width . 80)
                      (height . 25)
                      (minibuffer . t)
                      (menu-bar-lines . t)
                      (window-system . x))))

Please see the built-in help for more information on how to configure
the edit servers behaviour.

Browser Extension
-----------------

If you just want to install Edit with Emacs you can simply visit the
Chrome Store at:

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/edit-with-emacs/ljobjlafonikaiipfkggjbhkghgicgoh

Or if you're using Firefox, visit addons.mozilla.org (AMO) at:

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/edit-with-emacs1/

You then have the option of installing the packaged edit-server from the
options page or alternatively you can install the latest version from
MELPA if you have it enabled in Emacs 24+.

If you would like to help with the development of Edit with Emacs the
easiest way is to fork the github repository (https://github.com/stsquad/emacs_chrome)
and clone it to your development system. Then in Chrome(ium) go to:

Tools->Extensions
Select "Developer Mode"
Click "Load Unpacked Extension"

and point it at the cloned repository.

Hacking
=======

This modeline should be used in every source file to keep indentation
consistent:

    // -*- tab-width: 4; indent-tabs-mode: nil; c-basic-offset: 4 -*-

This tells both emacs use spaces instead of tabs and use a basic indentation
of 4 spaces.

There is also a universal .editorconfig which should enforce this.

The code has a fair amount of whitespace damage. Please don't submit
mega-patches to clean it up, just fixup the local code as you go. It
makes history harder to navigate as well as potentially introducing
changes in the noise.

There is currently a minimal Travis-CI control file which essentially
ensures the edit-server.el still compiles. Additions to the test
coverage are always welcome. ;-)

Submitting to Store
===================

* Update NEWS
* Test
* Update version in manifest.json
* Tag vX.Y
* git archive --format zip --output emacs_chrome_X.Y.zip vX.Y
* Upload that

History
=======

Dave Hilley [wrote the original proof of concept](https://web.archive.org/web/20130719135014/http://www.thegibson.org/blog/archives/689)
that showed it could be done. [I](http://www.bennee.com/~alex) then hacked around with the Javascript
to make the behaviour more like the classic It's All Text add-on available to Firefox.

Other Code
==========

This extensions takes advantage of the
[jQuery library](http://jquery.com/) to do a lot of the heavy lifting
in searching the page for elements.

It uses John Resig's
[jQuery Colour Animation](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color)
plug-in to do the colour fades of the elements.

The settings code uses Frank Kohlhepp's excellent fancy-settings
library. This has since
[been pulled from the web](https://github.com/frankkohlhepp/fancy-settings).

The textarea code uses the rather nifty
[mutation summary library](https://github.com/rafaelw/mutation-summary)
by Google.
